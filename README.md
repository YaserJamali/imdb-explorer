# imdb-explorer
this task created for globox human resource demand

Technical assignment
The purpose is for us to get a better understanding of your technical skills and focus.
There is no real deadline but we hope that you will have had the time to finish the project by this time next 2 weeks.
Spend a few days on it and attach a summary of what you would have done given more time.
The most important things are performance efficiency and code cleanness.

Use IMDB Dataset in order to develop these functionalities using Java 8+ and expose proper RESTful HTTP APIs :
1. Import the dataset into the application
2. Return all the titles in which both director and writer are the same person and he/she
is still alive
3. Get two actors and return all the titles in which both of them played at
4. Get a genre from the user and return best titles on each year for that genre based on
number of votes and rating
5. Count how many HTTP requests you received in this application since the last

startup



Considerations:

●  You Don’t have to use any external database application but if you want to just usethem in in-memory mode,
your application should run standalone

                ●  You are free to use any web framework you like but if you choose anything other
                      than Spring Boot you need to explain why

●  Do not implement any UI
